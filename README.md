## Brainstorm

### Idea 1: correlations/effects relating to assault weapons ban

Visualizing the effect of repealing the assault weapons ban. Law expired ('sunsetted') in 2004. 

Get data on # of fatalities / # of mass shootings with an assault rifle involved before and after 2004 



### Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act: 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban>
prohibited the manufacture or sale for civilian use of certain semi-automatic weapons. The act also banned magazines that could accommodate 10 rounds or more.

Goal: get data on assault-weapon-related crimes between 1994 and 2004, 
And compare that to 2004 - 2014 ? 


Research Question: Has the expiration of the federal assault weapons ban led to an increase in unlawful shootings involving an assault weapon? 

### Limitations: 
Is there enough data about the type of weapon used in mass shootings? 
Have we been recording this information far back enough? 



### Idea 2: Are some state safer than others regarding gun violence? 

What is the most dangerous state? 
What is the safest state? 
What laws do those safe states have? 

Is there a correlation between gun control laws and the amount of gun violence per state ? In other words, does gun control work?
